%Create a row vector population
population = [5000, 5200, 5350, 5600, 5800];

%Calculate the year-over-year growth rate
%Growth Rate =Present-Past/Past
%Last 4 Values in the population array - first 4 values / first four
growth_rate = (population(2:end) - population(1:end-1)) ./ population(1:end-1);

%Create a 2x5 matrix pop_data
pop_data = [population; [0 growth_rate]];

%Use fprintf to print a formatted table
%dashes in between column titles to act as dividers
fprintf('Year / Population / Growth Rate\n');

%for loop that repeats the number of years in the population row
%Make i = the number of loops to show the year
%print the pupulation number and data for the growth rate
%add dashes in between the numbers to act as dividers for the columns
for i = 1:length(population)
    fprintf('%d / %d / %.2f%%\n', i, population(i), pop_data(2, i) * 100);
end
